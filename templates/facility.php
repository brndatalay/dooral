    <p data-aos="zoom-in">The Pivot Doors rotate on a Pivot hinge that has a set of pins mounted on the top and bottom
        of the door. The hinge is offset from the door frame. The technology and design of a Pivot hinge allow for large
        doors that generally cannot be supported by traditional hinges. Pivot hinges are ideal for doors that are at
        least 42‚Äù wide. Outside of practicality, the door with its imaginative Pivot hinge system has a contemporary and
        seamless look. We recommend this kind of door for anyone looking for a modern, contemporary and transitional
        aesthetic.</p>
